					<h3>Appearance</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Nagi is a tall young man with a lean but muscular build. He is
							shown to have medium length white hair that leaves a V-shaped
							fringe in between his eyes. He has gray-colored eyes with large
							irises. Back in high school, Nagi wore a school uniform consisting
							of a white blazer with a cascading star pattern on the collar,
							though he wore a dark hoodie under it instead of a dress shirt and
							tie. He wore the dress pants and dress shoes as well. At Blue
							Lock, Nagi wears the standard-issued body suit (black with gray
							stripes) and tracksuit. During First Selection, he wore Team V's
							#11 jersey, and during Second Selection, he wore Team White's #7

					<h3>Personality</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Nagi is a very lazy and unmotivated person with an outstanding
							aptitude for football. He's unnaturally talented, with amazing
							reflexes, good speed, and jumping skills. But he has no interest
							in going pro or even playing at all at first. As long as he can
							get a decent job and keep living a lax life, he is content with
							doing nothing forever and often appears lethargic in his speech
							and body language. Introverted to a fault, he lives by himself in
							an apartment his parents pay for with only a pet cactus for
							company. He was shown to have no friends in high school before
							meeting Reo, and he frequently got gossiped about or possibly
							bullied. Even so, he demonstrates no interest in socializing and
							often has to be dragged into things by others, especially Reo. He
							initially does not want to put any effort into football and
							belittles those who are weak and talentless at the game since such
							things are easy for him.
